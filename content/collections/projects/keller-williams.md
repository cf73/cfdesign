            text: "Keller Williams is the world's largest realty company. I led a team of researchers and designers to bootstrap their new Mortgage platform from inception through launch (and subsequent sale when Keller exited the market in response to wider economic conditions). Our 'Lean Startup' process allowed us to hone in on a strategy of financial empowerment for prospective homebuyers, creating a suite of best-in-class tools and offering a 'soft-sell' approach. Crucially, we chose 'qualified leads' over merely 'leads' as our core success metric, which ensured all downstream UX work focused on building rich relationships between prospective homeowner, Loan Officer and Agent."

            text: 'Key to our strategy was positioning the KW Loan Officer as partner with the realty agent. This allowed customers to conduct their home search in light of shared, articulated financial goals, both short and long term. Visual diagrams created a sense of transparency and approachability, helping customers understand the structure of the KW team working with them.'

This search could be captured and shared with both Loan Officer and Agent. The likelihood of successful closing was higher with these more calibrated expectations in place.'

            text: 'Positioning Keller Mortgage as more of a ‘suite of tools’ to help prospective homeowners, rather than taking a traditional ‘hard sell’ approach, we prominently featured a ‘Total Cost Analysis’ tool. Capturing even initial clicks into the various parameters, such as ‘Rent vs Buy?’, we were able to deepen conversations between customers and their Loan Officers and Agents.'

A few checkboxes with tooltips set up a ‘call and response’ pattern of low-friction educational content, while building a rich lead record on the backend.'

Through multiple rounds of testing over a year and half of development, this unique strategy was validated as remarkably effective in both winning customers in a crowded market, while reducing barriers to the dream of homeownership for thousands of customers.'
