            text: "Where other navigation and mobility apps feature long flows of static, densely-packed screens, I explored an 'ennactivist' approach to wayfinding when showcasing Mobi's unique multi-modal technology: users see instant results on a map, giving them real-time feedback by which to then continue to dial in their route and travel preferences. The innovative 'dial' interface makes use of the phone's haptic motor to provide reassuring physical clicks that correspond to the acceleration curve of either flicking or scrolling carefully through the various route options. Underlying this design was the goal of creating a more comfortable, tactile, and intuitive experience given the stressful context that navigation typically occurs in."
