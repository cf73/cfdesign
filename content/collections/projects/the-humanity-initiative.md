            text: 'A major challenge was finding a way to present ostensibly disconnected content such that connections are suggested and browsing feels expansive and seductive, rather than dissonant. Closely nested cards, built on a randomizer, allow content to be sorted, filtered, or simply experienced in a low-friction, intuitive fashion, the organic grid working with the various aspect ratios of the images while also creating visual rhythms and breaking up what might otherwise appear more transactional and unapproachable.'
